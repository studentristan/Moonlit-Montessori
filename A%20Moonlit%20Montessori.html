<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>Moonlit (adj.) - Lit by the moon. Typically describes objects that exist in a night-time scene.</p><p>Montessori - Montessori is a scientifically based education approach that emphasizes independence, freedom within limits, and respect for a child's natural psychological, physical, and social development. <div class="tooltip"><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="History%2520of%2520Montessori.html">History</a><div class="tooltiptext">Maria Montessori was an Italian physician, educator, and innovator, acclaimed for her educational method that builds on the way children learn naturally. She opened the first Montessori school—the Casa dei Bambini, or Children's House—in Rome on January 6, 1907.

<a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://amshq.org/About-Montessori/History-of-Montessori/Who-Was-Maria-Montessori" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Source</a></div></div>.</p><p>I was inspired to start this website one night while hyper-focusing on ways to build up a writing habit and expand your portfolio at the same time. During this late-night journey I stumbled across <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://www.notion.so/A-Brief-History-Ethos-of-the-Digital-Garden-609601bddd644ff18eb1500fd064084a" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this article</a> about Virtual Gardening by Maggie Appleton. I’ve been a long time user of Notion, loving it for it’s spider-web style of note taking, with back-links and references galore. When approached with the idea of writing a blog in that style, the little ADHD monkey in my brain did a backflip and screamed in joy. </p><p>Then the monkey realized that I would actually have to build a website and wilted a little. I had done some light Web-Dev for college before this, but I never enjoyed it all that much. Programming is fun, but I personally kind of hate the traditional web development workflow. My solution was to see if someone else had done the work for me, and I lucked out. Using <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://www.notion.so/How-to-build-a-digital-garden-with-TiddlyWiki-Ness-Labs-056c64d3c1cb4db795274650639a16d5" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this</a> great (and slightly outdated) tutorial, I quite easily got a fully-customizable website put together. All I had to do was make it actually look good, and then once I was happy with it I would launch it onto the World Wide Web for all to enjoy. Well, making it look good sounded like work, so first I did all the back-end work of getting it launched for free on <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="GitHub.html">GitHub</a> with a completely empty landing page. You can go <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://github.com/studentristan/Moonlit-Montessori/commits/main" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">back in the commits</a> to see the process of the website coming into existence. (You can also see me struggle endlessly with Git. It’s just never been something I’m good at. Feel free to bully me if you’d like.) Once I had the page up on <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="GitHub.html">GitHub</a>, I had no choice but to start working on the visual styling and UI of the page. When faced with this big, scary, long-term commitment to cleanliness and organization, the ADHD monkey decided that it instead wanted to look for a distraction. This is when I realized I hadn’t come up with a name for the site. </p><p>When trying to name this page, I struggled a lot. I started this project on a Wednesday night, and a part of my goal was to start a weekly writing habit. I was going to call it the “Weekly Wednesday Wasteland.” That idea was called stupid (rightfully so) by all of my friends and peers. So I went back to the drawing board. I started writing down random names to use, riffing off of the original and also throwing in some truly random thoughts. Here’s a sampling of what I came up with:</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Mental Wasteland</p><p>Confused Vines</p><p>Wandering Waves</p><p>Thoughts for the Sick and Deranged</p><p>What am I doing  with myself?</p><p>Dazed and Confuzzled</p><p>Wandering Wonderer</p><p>Classified Confusions</p><p>Carrion Food (Thoughts for the internet to rip apart)</p><p>Frantically Typing</p><p>Lazy Lark</p><p>Lost Thoughts of a Man Gone Bored.</p><p>Texting in the Moonlight (and I was gonna use the intro riff from “ Dancing in the Moonlight “ every time you opened a new page, along with the iPhone “sent” sound every time you hovered a link)</p></blockquote><p>Obviously you can see why I went with the name I did. Not only was it the best one I thought of creatively, it’s also the most accurate to me personally. I thought of the moonlight idea simply due to the fact that I’m regularly awake all through the night, and I do a lot of my work with the moon shining through my window. The Montessori idea came from both my goals for this site combined with my background. A Montessori school is a school built around the concept of letting children learn at their natural pace, following their own interests and desires. That’s basically exactly how I like to learn: a partially-focused effort to cram vaguely-relevant information into my brain, all steered by my wandering thoughts and curiosity. I additionally thought that the name was appropriate considering my long-term employment in the field of education technology. I have experience both with the more technical support/development side as well as experience teaching students CIS fundamentals and getting them excited to learn using technology.</p></div>
